[Azure Cognitive Services](/azure/cognitive-services/) can be used to improve a variety of gaming scenarios, both in- and out-of-game.  Here are a few ideas to consider as you are building your game:

* [Text Translation](/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/gaming-concepts)
  * Translate text between languages so players across the world can communicate with each other in their native language.
* [Speech-to-Text](/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/gaming-concepts) and [Text-to-Speech](/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/gaming-concepts)
  * Bring everyone into the conversation by synthesizing audio from text. Or by displaying text from audio.  
  * Game dialogue prototyping to shorten the amount of time and money spent in product to get the game to market sooner, you can rapidly swap lines of dialog and listen to variations in real-time to iterate the game content.
  * Make the game more accessible. Players can listen to storylines and instructions in their preferred language. This enables players who are unable to read or read text in a particular language, including young players who haven't learnt to read and write, to be able to play your game.
  * Branded voice building for NPC with consistent quality and speaking style, you can add emotions, accents, nuances, laughter, and other paralinguistic sounds and expressions.
  * Prebuilt neural voice and custom neural voice features. Prebuilt neural voice can provide highly natural out-of-box voices with leading voice variety in terms of a large portfolio of languages and voices. Custom neural voice is an easy-to-use self-service for creating a highly natural custom voice.
